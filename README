###  How to run this project

It's pretty easily, honestly!

1) Unpackage this in the root of your application server.  The directory should be "angular-customer-maintenance-utility-master", unless something really went sideways.
2) Once unpacked, just dump her on in the ole %DocumentRoot%.  Assuming your app server is running, fire up Mosiac or whatever it is the kids use these days to browse the internet world wide web page sites.  Assuming you have domain indexing set up (which, why wouldn't you, it's not the Dark Ages), append /angular-customer-maintenance-utility-master to the url 
   for your server.  It should like something like http://your-server-here/angular-customer-maintenance-utility-master.
3) Once you are able to view the application, you'll see you have the ability to add new records and edit (or delete) current customer records.

I would have used npm or git, but I don't know what you all have access to there.  I know it sounds Draconian, but I have worked at some companies where you had/have to put in 
tickets just to get access to a site/service that will eventually get blown out as soon as they update the firewall.  I figured zipping the files up and sending them in a package was
potentially easier.  If you want access to them on github or something, no problem.
