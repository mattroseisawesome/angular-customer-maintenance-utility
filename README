###  How to run this project

It's pretty easy, honestly!

1) Unpack this in the root of your application server.  The directory should be "angular-customer-maintenance-utility-master", unless something really went sideways.
2) Once unpacked, just dump her on in the ole %DocumentRoot%.  Assuming your app server is running, fire up Mosiac or whatever it is the kids use these days to browse the internet world wide web page sites.  Assuming you have domain indexing set up, append /angular-customer-maintenance-utility-master to the url for your server.  It should like something like http://your-server-here/angular-customer-maintenance-utility-master.  If you want to virtual host this sumbitch, be my guest.
3) Once you are able to view the application, you'll see you have the ability to add new records and edit (or delete) current customer records.
